        <p>It’s interesting that Rome is called the Eternal City because my time there was anything but eternal. Two and a half weeks seemed to slip away marked with pasta, walking, and laughter.</p><p>Romans were unforgettable. Sharply dressed, beautiful, and brimming with pride. Leaving food on the table was not an option in Rome. Sometimes, when Qavalina didn’t like her food, I ended the night downing two pasta dishes instead of one. I just couldn’t let the owner down.</p><p>And our days were full of countless wonders. It’s incredible all we were able to see in a day. One of my favorites was the Vatican and the necropolis. We ended the morning at one of the highest points in the city, and we started the afternoon underneath it all in the city of the dead. It was an incredible contrast, and one that made the day unforgettable. That and seeing St. Peter’s bones. I’m not religious, but when the tour guide pointed out the fragments in a plexiglass case, something came over me. I felt the weight of hundreds of years of tradition sitting right in front of my eyes.</p><p>Augustus found Rome bricks and left her clothed in marble. I came to Rome in cotton and left in linen suits. The men’s fashion was the best I had ever seen. Shirts, suits, and shoes. My first few days in Rome I scrutinized the local men, to see how they dressed. The class and the elegance of wealthy older Italian men left me feeling like an absolute outsider. My shirts sung tourist. My shoes were a laughingstock. My goal became to dress like an Italian, and to fit in.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My Linens and Loafers</figcaption></figure><p>And so began the shopping. Was it slightly overkill? Yes. Do I regret any purchase? No. By the end of the trip I was strutting in handmade suede loafers and outfitted in full linen suits. Some days it would be 80 plus degrees, and I would be wearing a suit jacket and trousers. Beauty is pain.</p><p>There’s much to be said about the food in Rome as well. There was such incredible bounty. One restaurant Ruma became our regular spot. The chef there was a genius. He didn’t have the classic Italian dishes like Cacio e Pepe or Carbonara, but the care with which his platters were created, and the combinations were unlike anything I had ever seen. Our go-to was a trio of distinct dishes: a plate of thinly sliced roast beef, topped with pickled onions, pesto and olive oil; asparagus with walnuts and creamy burrata; and prosciutto paired with buffalo mozzarella. We ordered this exact array three times and it never got old.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The holy trinity&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of my most memorable moments in Rome was taking a home one day when we were tired, and it was raining. Riding through the city felt like real life Roman Holiday. We passed the Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II and wove through the road near the Campidoglio. All the while cars were honking and cutting each other off.</p><p>The city didn’t seem modern, it was ancient, slightly restructured for use in the modern era. The winding streets were barely able to hold the wide-bodied S-class Mercedes Benzes that I occasionally saw driving through.</p><p>I’ll never forget when Professor Curley said, “Ah Roma, she giveth and she taketh.” In one sense that is the Rome I saw. I never knew what to expect. Sometimes presentations were called off because of large crowds or unknown hours, and sometimes magical sites were empty with no one to view them, like the Talking Statues. It was a city of hidden wonders: an orange grove here and a cemetery of famous writers there. And there was always more in Rome.</p><p>Places that we didn’t get to see. Restaurants I didn’t get to eat at. Shops that I didn’t get to browse. More than anything Rome was a city that I could not know, but one that I came to love.</p><p>By the time we had to go I was already scheming about how I could come back. Remote internship, get an apartment, and just chill for a summer. Hopefully that’s in the cards for me at some point because I love Rome’s spirit.</p><p>I love the crowded buses, the annoyed locals, the clean water, and the fresh vegetables. It was a special place, and one I feel deeply connected to. Thank you, and ciao Roma.</p>
