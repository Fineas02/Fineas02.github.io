        <p>I woke up grumpy and irritable. We had the morning off, but I didn’t feel rested. As I walked to get a coffee at my usual spot, the feel of my new suit jacket served to cheer me up a bit. It was a gorgeous blue, not too dark, and not too light. And, like all Italian clothes, it hung off my shoulders like it had been hand crafted to my specifications. The cappuccino and cream croissant further boosted my mood. By the time I met Qavalina at the bus stop I was humming and walking with a bounce in my step.</p><p>The bridge of the Castel was a magnificent preface for what was to come. Statues loomed over us, beautiful, but ominous. It seemed no accident that the history of the Castel contained much for the angels to warn passers of the bridge about. Had it been the 14th century, we could’ve been prisoners awaiting a grisly execution.</p><p>The history of the Castel was messy, tinged with blood and ash. But also, with beauty and legendary Catholic tradition. The building gets its name from 590 AD, when Archangel Michael appeared on top of the structure, and buried his sword in its sheath, to signal the end of a plague in Rome.</p><p>Inside the Castel I was greeted with long winding corridors and eerie prison cells. It was dark and cool, shut off from the outside world. The roof of the Castel was a vibrant contrast to its gloomy interior. 360-degree panoramic views of the city, from the heart of Rome. Qavalina and I spent about five minutes guessing buildings we had visited and piecing together a mental map of the city. It was a gratifying exercise that spoke to how much we had learned in the past few months. Though, some impossibly large structures that we couldn’t name reminded us of how much there still was to see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>View of the Vatican from atop the Castel.</figcaption></figure><p>On the way down we checked out the art galleries. They were unique. Seeing so much sculpture and art throughout the trip from so many big names had desensitized me in a way. When I checked the inscriptions and didn’t recognize the artists, at first it turned me off.</p><p>Then, I changed my perspective. Instead of focusing on names, I looked deeply at the pictures, and the moments the artists were trying to capture. When I really hunted, I found things that I hadn’t seen before. A woman getting torn apart by a dog. A gorgeous depiction of a unicorn. Everywhere there was something to find, all I needed to do was look.</p><p>                Ekphrasis</p><p>His coat is snow white, and as soft as the silk of his master’s flowing garments. She is adorned in robes of unmatched texture and quality. Her ruffled pink dress gives way to a patterned silk blanket, wrapped around her shoulder and thigh. It seems to be crafted from the wind itself, with etchings of blue and silver. A golden belt wraps her torso, exemplifying both the beauty and power she holds.</p><p>He loves his master; she is all he has ever known. Her hand both guides and comforts him, half wrapped around his muscular neck. She is gentle but firm. That’s been made clear to him throughout their time together. There is punishment when he doesn’t obey, though that hasn’t happened since he was a colt. Never extreme, always befitting the crime, but still a reminder of his obligation to her.</p><p>Her hair flows over her shoulder and partway down her back. Auburn is its color, topped with a majestic pearl and diamond tiara. More than her crown, her bold gaze distinguishes her as royalty. With her plump lips set, and her eyes locked, there is no disobeying. He knows as much.</p><p>His eyes are filled with the image of her countenance. To him, there is nothing else in the world that matters. How could there be anything else? She is the world. He would kill for her. Again.</p><p>Over a foot of refined keratin pierces through armor and chainmail as if it’s paper. Though he is a thing of myth and magic with a flowing silver mane, he is also a being of war. It’s what he was bred for. It’s how he can protect the one he loves.</p><p>She reaches towards his nose, and he leans in to meet her touch. They share a bond. Something deeper than friendship and more profound than love. Built on subservience and tempered with years of respect and trust. Nothing breaks this bond. Not even death.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Lady and the Unicorn by Luca Longhi.</figcaption></figure>
