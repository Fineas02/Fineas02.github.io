        <p>I look around confused as I pull into parking lot V.  The man in the toll booth gives me a quizzical stare when I try to explain that I’m visiting for a class trip. He gestures me on and gives an ambivalent shrug. I know I’m in the right place when I see Professor Curley with a group of students in tow.</p><p>The transition from the parking garage to the concourse is blinding. As we step out of the elevator, sterile white rushes to replace the muted grays of the underground. The concourse is a portal. It is narrow and filled with movement; people hustle back and forth, coming and going. A classmate remarks it seems like an airport passageway. Another compares it to a train station. We all seem to agree that the concourse is, at its heart, a facilitator of motion. Even though it is dressed to be more, with colorful modern art decorating the walls, no one is fooled. A puppy with a tiara and a tutu is cute, but it’s still a dog.</p><p>The Rockefeller Plaza is a different story. As I take in the view from the top of the museum steps, I’m wowed by the sheer scale and grandiosity unfurled below me. The government agency buildings seem to float, concrete blending seamlessly into glass. They are stark and imperial, but awe inspiring, nonetheless. The vector that cuts through the center of the plaza brings the gaze to the capitol building. It is intricate, proud, and massive. A building fit for Hogwarts, or a billionaire’s private estate. But, in a way, it brings the plaza together. The beauty and delicacy of the design, suitable for any location. It is a peacock at the party: distinct, outrageous, and resplendently stunning.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/04/IMG_0463.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 1600w, ../content/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>New York State Capitol Building</figcaption></figure><p>As we walk through the plaza, I get a closer view of the Egg. It is odd, but somehow loveable. Laughable and appreciable at the same time. The view, as I stand with my back to the capitol building, sends chills down my spine. Rockefeller’s imperial dream complete in front of my eyes. The only element missing from the picture is a Death Star, that looms above the New York State Museum. Though the sight is not a stimulant of creativity, it does dredge up a certain admiration for the design and execution. The order and scale of the structures are impressive, and taken together, they are beautiful, in their own ominous way.</p><p>After we finish our loop, a group of us head off to grab a snack from a Greek food truck. The window is closed, but the owner decides to make an exception when he spies five hungry college customers. As he makes the food, we start to chat. “You know half of people don’t know anything about upper-level math.”, he quips, his brow furrowed. I nod and tell him I’m studying math and computer science. When he hears this, his expression changes, and his look becomes almost wistful. “I was a math major in college”, he says. “I fucked up though, and now look where I am.” At this he raises his hands and gestures around the food truck.</p><p>My interest is piqued, and I want to ask for his story. I hesitate though, unsure if I will come across as rude. Then, the group starts to leave, and I follow. As I walk, I look back, filled with regret at missing an opportunity to learn from the man, and maybe procure some pearls of wisdom.<br>As we walk, the wind picks up and trash ripples through the courtyard near the capitol building. For all its grandeur, the space is not very well maintained.</p><p>We settle down to eat at picnic tables near the Egg. I notice a man lying flat on his back, atop a table nearby. He appears to be sleeping. This is the first real use I’ve seen of the amenities contained in the plaza. In a few minutes, the rest of the group starts to join us, and the man gets up and walks off. A little while later a cop car rolls through, headed in the exact same direction that the man had headed.</p><p>My experience at Empire State Plaza is one that highlights how important people are to any space. I’m reminded of the periods in Rome’s history when crime was high, conditions were poor, and people moved out of the city. Was it similar to the feel of the Empire State Plaza today? The whole mini tour, we were surrounded by structures of exorbitant scale. Billions of dollars turned to concrete and steel in every direction we looked, yet the space was flat, and felt dead without the touch of human life.</p><p>      (Empire State Plaza.
