Two and a half weeks seemed to slip away marked with pasta, walking, and laughter.</p><p>Romans were unforgettable. Sharply dressed, beautiful, and brimming with pride. Leaving food on the table was not an option in Rome. Sometimes, when Qavalina didn&#x2019;t like her food, I ended the night downing two pasta dishes instead of one. I just couldn&#x2019;t let the owner down.</p><p>And our days were full of countless wonders. It&#x2019;s incredible all we were able to see in a day. One of my favorites was the Vatican and the necropolis. We ended the morning at one of the highest points in the city, and we started the afternoon underneath it all in the city of the dead. It was an incredible contrast, and one that made the day unforgettable. That and seeing St. Peter&#x2019;s bones. I&#x2019;m not religious, but when the tour guide pointed out the fragments in a plexiglass case, something came over me. I felt the weight of hundreds of years of tradition sitting right in front of my eyes.</p><p>Augustus found Rome bricks and left her clothed in marble. I came to Rome in cotton and left in linen suits. The men&#x2019;s fashion was the best I had ever seen. Shirts, suits, and shoes. My first few days in Rome I scrutinized the local men, to see how they dressed. The class and the elegance of wealthy older Italian men left me feeling like an absolute outsider. My shirts sung tourist. My shoes were a laughingstock. My goal became to dress like an Italian, and to fit in.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Envoi" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0841.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My Linens and Loafers</figcaption></figure><p>And so began the shopping. Was it slightly overkill? Yes. Do I regret any purchase? No. By the end of the trip I was strutting in handmade suede loafers and outfitted in full linen suits. Some days it would be 80 plus degrees, and I would be wearing a suit jacket and trousers. Beauty is pain.</p><p>There&#x2019;s much to be said about the food in Rome as well. There was such incredible bounty. One restaurant Ruma became our regular spot. The chef there was a genius. He didn&#x2019;t have the classic Italian dishes like Cacio e Pepe or Carbonara, but the care with which his platters were created, and the combinations were unlike anything I had ever seen. Our go-to was a trio of distinct dishes: a plate of thinly sliced roast beef, topped with pickled onions, pesto and olive oil; asparagus with walnuts and creamy burrata; and prosciutto paired with buffalo mozzarella. We ordered this exact array three times and it never got old.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Envoi" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0771.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The holy trinity&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p>One of my most memorable moments in Rome was taking a home one day when we were tired, and it was raining. Riding through the city felt like real life Roman Holiday. We passed the Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II and wove through the road near the Campidoglio. All the while cars were honking and cutting each other off.</p><p>The city didn&#x2019;t seem modern, it was ancient, slightly restructured for use in the modern era. The winding streets were barely able to hold the wide-bodied S-class Mercedes Benzes that I occasionally saw driving through.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll never forget when Professor Curley said, &#x201C;Ah Roma, she giveth and she taketh.&#x201D; In one sense that is the Rome I saw. I never knew what to expect. Sometimes presentations were called off because of large crowds or unknown hours, and sometimes magical sites were empty with no one to view them, like the Talking Statues. It was a city of hidden wonders: an orange grove here and a cemetery of famous writers there. And there was always more in Rome.</p><p>Places that we didn&#x2019;t get to see. Restaurants I didn&#x2019;t get to eat at. Shops that I didn&#x2019;t get to browse. More than anything Rome was a city that I could not know, but one that I came to love.</p><p>By the time we had to go I was already scheming about how I could come back. Remote internship, get an apartment, and just chill for a summer. Hopefully that&#x2019;s in the cards for me at some point because I love Rome&#x2019;s spirit.</p><p>I love the crowded buses, the annoyed locals, the clean water, and the fresh vegetables. It was a special place, and one I feel deeply connected to. Thank you, and ciao Roma.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Four Senses Rome]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The leaves seem to sing in bliss, full of gratitude toward the cool breeze.

As I sit, a hushed melody of summer fills my ears. Feet pound on the gravel nearby, each step punctuated by a resounding crunch.</p><p>A cry echoes from a child, followed by the thwack of a foot connecting with a ball. A deeper voice shouts &#x201C;Bravo, bravo,&#x201D; and I hear the clapping of hands. From the same direction, I&#x2019;m bombarded by the rich smell of cooking meat.</p><p>And the breeze flows again, as if to reward me for a hard day of travel. The whispering leaves seem to encourage me to keep pushing forward. &#x201C;But take a quick rest now,&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re here to take care of you.&#x201D;</p><p>A smile forms on my lips and my shoulders relax. Suddenly, there&#x2019;s a loud exclamation right in front of me, and I tense back up. A young voice exclaims in a breathy tone, &#x201C;Catch me if you can,&#x201D; followed by fast footfalls on gravel. A few seconds pass and then I feel a rush of air as someone else hustles past me.</p><p>All is calm for a moment, and then I take it all in. The way the sun kisses my face, persistent, but not overbearing. The scent of the air, fresh and clean. I&#x2019;m so grateful in this moment. To be here in Rome. To live the present moment among the prolific monuments of the past. It&#x2019;s the perfect end to the day, and the perfect way to start the summer.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Giornale II]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>A croissant shouldn&#x2019;t be this good.

My first thought as I inspected my ham and cheese breakfast. It was just a slice of ham, some small blocks of rich cheddar, a piece of arugula, and a light mustard sauce. But that was Rome. Simple done to perfection.</p><p>Sant&apos;Ivo alla Sapienza was impressive, but it wasn&#x2019;t until, in a hushed voice, Dr. Spinner explained more about its history did I truly appreciate the structure. Designed by Borromini and commissioned by the University of Rome, the structure was built on an irregularly shaped plot of land. Where most buildings were created with traditional rectangular or square shape, Borromini designed Sant&apos;Ivo with a complex geometric plan based on the interplay of circles and equilateral triangles.</p><p>Nestled in the courtyard of the ancient university, it was as if the church had sprouted from the cobblestones, reaching towards the heavens with its intricate spiral spire.</p><p>Inside was just as stunning, if not more so. The air was cool, the scent of time-weathered stone and aged wood mingling with the lingering incense. The high walls soared upward, culminating in the distinctive spiral dome, a serpentine trail of layered symbolism. Its geometric purity gave the building a strange sensation of both balance and dynamism, creating an echo of the divine in a harmony of shapes and light.</p><p>The details of the church were sublime. The walls were adorned with intricate frescoes that narrated the life of Saint Ivo and the virtues of wisdom, each brush stroke a testament to the faith and artistry of the past. Carved into the stone, the ornate reliefs depicted the history of the university, stories of philosophers and scholars whose pursuit of knowledge was held in the same regard as the spiritual journey of the church.</p><p>Students sat on the benches of the church, headphones on and looking upwards. Sketchbooks and pencils in hand. It was nice to see the spirit of wisdom and instruction embodied inside the very structure created to commemorate and exemplify both.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0691.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Giornale II" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0691.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0691.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0691.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0691.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The gorgeous ceiling of St. Ivo&apos;s.</figcaption></figure><p>I stood there; my croissant forgotten. Sant&apos;Ivo alla Sapienza wasn&apos;t just a church, it was a reflection of Rome itself. It was a place of devotion, of learning, and of beauty. A place where the simple became extraordinary. Sant&#x2019;Ivo was defined by its constraints. The limitation, of the irregularity of the land, forcing breathtaking innovation. It was then, I realized, Rome wasn&#x2019;t just about doing simple to perfection. It was about taking the imperfect and making it divine.</p><p>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003; Voyeur</p><p>His furtive gaze instantly marked him as an outsider. That and the ruffled collared shirt. But the one of the gifts of pursuing knowledge was that everyone cared less about what you looked like and more about what you knew. Or, what you wanted to know. That&#x2019;s what brought Dan out to Sant&#x2019;Ivo&#x2019;s. He wanted to learn.</p><p>Dan&apos;s roots were humble, a upbringing of simplicity that provided an unlikely backdrop to his extraordinary mind. His intelligence led him to excel academically, securing a full scholarship to a renowned university. This was only the beginning, for Dan&apos;s success in the challenging Putnam Exam did more than just highlight his intellect; it brought him to the attention of Citadel, a titan in the world of high-frequency trading.</p><p>The offer Citadel made was far from ordinary &#x2013; a staggering seven-figure salary straight out of undergrad. It was the kind of opportunity that was impossible to decline, so Dan dove headfirst into the frenetic world of money and markets.</p><p>Three decades passed, three decades of hard work and relentless pursuit of success. Yet, deep within, a part of Dan remained unsatisfied. Trading had brought him wealth, but it hadn&apos;t fulfilled his thirst for knowledge. So, he made a bold choice, a choice to leave it all behind.</p><p>Dan looked admiringly at the students sketching. They were so young, and yet, they were so immersed. They were doing what they loved, studying art and architecture. They were driven by passion, not by the pursuit of wealth. At this he sighed. What he would give to do it all over again.</p><p>But he had taken a different path, and it paid. Dividends.</p><p>He took out his sketchbook and plugged in his earbuds. A calm voice continued explaining the roots of Sant&#x2019;Ivo&#x2019;s, how Borromini had crafted his masterpiece.</p><p>Dan looked up at the ceiling and a rush of gratitude flooded over him. What a gift that he was able to be in Rome, viewing masterpieces, sketching. Rekindling lost passions. And learning, always learning. About art, architecture, history. All the things he had missed while on a laser focused path to success.</p><p>It had been a long road, but it felt like Dan was finally home.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0693.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Giornale II" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0693.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0693.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0693.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0693.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dan contemplating life.</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ekphrasis Rome]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Bound in the silent throes of marble, the eternal dance of predator and prey manifests.

A lion, the embodiment of raw strength and regal ferocity, grips its prey with dagger-like claws. He rips into the horse&apos;s pristine white hide, an intimate act of savagery that belies the serene stillness of the stone. The lion&apos;s jaw is clamped, his teeth embedded. The horse&#x2019;s flesh melts away like butter on a toasted piece of bread. There is grandeur in his savagery, nobility in his form. His mane, as much a halo as a crown, frames a face that radiates regal prowess, and visceral power.</p><p>The horse, forever frozen in its final moment, pleads helplessly to onlookers nearby. His body arches in a desperate attempt at escape, and his eyes scan the ground. There is a blankness in his look, a recognition, and maybe even an acceptance, that this is his final moment. Yet, his flowing mane, and sinewy muscular legs, set him apart as a stallion. A leader, and an alpha. To his tribe he was the strongest, but to the lion he is dinner.</p><p>This moment illuminates an essential truth of nature&#x2014;its merciless cycles and its poignant beauty. It is a symphony of power, fear, grace, and survival. The sculpture resonates with life&apos;s primal melody&#x2014;an echo of the natural world&apos;s cruel yet captivating dance. Kingdoms rise and fall. The strong conquer the weak. Today&#x2019;s legend falls to tomorrow&#x2019;s rising star. And life goes on.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Giornale III]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I woke up grumpy and irritable.

We had the morning off, but I didn&#x2019;t feel rested. As I walked to get a coffee at my usual spot, the feel of my new suit jacket served to cheer me up a bit. It was a gorgeous blue, not too dark, and not too light. And, like all Italian clothes, it hung off my shoulders like it had been hand crafted to my specifications. The cappuccino and cream croissant further boosted my mood. By the time I met Qavalina at the bus stop I was humming and walking with a bounce in my step.</p><p>The bridge of the Castel was a magnificent preface for what was to come. Statues loomed over us, beautiful, but ominous. It seemed no accident that the history of the Castel contained much for the angels to warn passers of the bridge about. Had it been the 14th century, we could&#x2019;ve been prisoners awaiting a grisly execution.</p><p>The history of the Castel was messy, tinged with blood and ash. But also, with beauty and legendary Catholic tradition. The building gets its name from 590 AD, when Archangel Michael appeared on top of the structure, and buried his sword in its sheath, to signal the end of a plague in Rome.</p><p>Inside the Castel I was greeted with long winding corridors and eerie prison cells. It was dark and cool, shut off from the outside world. The roof of the Castel was a vibrant contrast to its gloomy interior. 360-degree panoramic views of the city, from the heart of Rome. Qavalina and I spent about five minutes guessing buildings we had visited and piecing together a mental map of the city. It was a gratifying exercise that spoke to how much we had learned in the past few months. Though, some impossibly large structures that we couldn&#x2019;t name reminded us of how much there still was to see.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Giornale III" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0830.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>View of the Vatican from atop the Castel.</figcaption></figure><p>On the way down we checked out the art galleries. They were unique. Seeing so much sculpture and art throughout the trip from so many big names had desensitized me in a way. When I checked the inscriptions and didn&#x2019;t recognize the artists, at first it turned me off.</p><p>Then, I changed my perspective. Instead of focusing on names, I looked deeply at the pictures, and the moments the artists were trying to capture. When I really hunted, I found things that I hadn&#x2019;t seen before. A woman getting torn apart by a dog. A gorgeous depiction of a unicorn. Everywhere there was something to find, all I needed to do was look.</p><p>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;Ekphrasis</p><p>His coat is snow white, and as soft as the silk of his master&#x2019;s flowing garments. She is adorned in robes of unmatched texture and quality. Her ruffled pink dress gives way to a patterned silk blanket, wrapped around her shoulder and thigh. It seems to be crafted from the wind itself, with etchings of blue and silver. A golden belt wraps her torso, exemplifying both the beauty and power she holds.</p><p>He loves his master; she is all he has ever known. Her hand both guides and comforts him, half wrapped around his muscular neck. She is gentle but firm. That&#x2019;s been made clear to him throughout their time together. There is punishment when he doesn&#x2019;t obey, though that hasn&#x2019;t happened since he was a colt. Never extreme, always befitting the crime, but still a reminder of his obligation to her.</p><p>Her hair flows over her shoulder and partway down her back. Auburn is its color, topped with a majestic pearl and diamond tiara. More than her crown, her bold gaze distinguishes her as royalty. With her plump lips set, and her eyes locked, there is no disobeying. He knows as much.</p><p>His eyes are filled with the image of her countenance. To him, there is nothing else in the world that matters. How could there be anything else? She is the world. He would kill for her. Again.</p><p>Over a foot of refined keratin pierces through armor and chainmail as if it&#x2019;s paper. Though he is a thing of myth and magic with a flowing silver mane, he is also a being of war. It&#x2019;s what he was bred for. It&#x2019;s how he can protect the one he loves.</p><p>She reaches towards his nose, and he leans in to meet her touch. They share a bond. Something deeper than friendship and more profound than love. Built on subservience and tempered with years of respect and trust. Nothing breaks this bond. Not even death.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Giornale III" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/IMG_0832.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The Lady and the Unicorn by Luca Longhi.</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Voyeur Roma]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Surrounded by countless wonders of the world, Lucia works.

People come to the Vatican and try to steal the stones; Lucia&#x2019;s job is to stop them before they get a chance. This nail is wedged in deep though, so Lucia radios for help. A few minutes later, her teammate Lorenzo comes with a pair of industrial steel wire cutters and pulls out the nail.</p><p>Lucia sighs from exhaustion and heads over to the small fountain nearby. She runs the cool water through her dark brown hair. Then she dunks her head into the fountain pool. A tourist gasps nearby, as Lucia pulls her dripping head from the fountain. At this, Lucia chuckles inwardly. The crazier they think she is, the better. No one suspects a crazy lady, so she hears all sorts of things.</p><p>Plots to steal valuable artifacts from the basilica. Plans to smuggle in illicit substances under the pretense of a religious pilgrimage. Hushed discussions plotting against the Vatican&apos;s political interests. All information makes its way to her, unnoticed. People shift away from her as she walks by, as if Lucia carries a disease. But they don&#x2019;t stop talking. And this is what makes Lucia so good; it&#x2019;s why she is recognized as the best at USO.</p><p>Back in the square, Lorenzo is now fumbling with the nail, examining it with a careful eye. Lucia approaches him, leaving a trail of water droplets behind. &quot;Find anything interesting?&quot; she asks casually. Lorenzo grunts in response, not looking up.</p><p>&quot;Seems to be a GPS tracker embedded in this,&quot; he murmurs, prying at the nail with a small, delicate tool.</p><p>&quot;Again?&quot; Lucia feigns surprise, leaning in to get a closer look at the seemingly innocuous object. Lorenzo nods, handing over the nail to Lucia who takes it with a firm grip. She inspects it closely, a hint of a smirk playing on her lips. Just another day at the Vatican.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/05/IMG_7931.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Voyeur Roma" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2667" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/05/IMG_7931.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/05/IMG_7931.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/05/IMG_7931.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/05/IMG_7931.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Vatican.

We&#x2019;re late; traffic was bumper to bumper for the last forty minutes of the ride. Inside the airport I find total chaos. Check in kiosk&#x2019;s have lines four families deep, and the baggage drop off seems to span endlessly, like Tartarus.</p><p>Qavalina manages to print her checked bag ticket. The instant it has left the machine, she rushes off to the bag drop-off. I look around. The fear, impatience, and anger in the air is palpable. I understand then that it&#x2019;s every person for themselves. There are no friends here.</p><p>My machine sends me on a different path than Qavalina. I receive a ticket that beckons me to the left, to the full-service bag line. The ticket says I need to speak with an agent. I don&#x2019;t know why, and I want to try checking in again, but the hot air on my neck from the man standing behind me, advises me to do otherwise.</p><p>The full-service bag line is even more infinite than the bag drop-off. At this point, the pee I&#x2019;ve been holding since the start of the car ride is screaming to be released. By the time I&#x2019;ve made it around the third loop of the cordoned off area, each step is a struggle. I can&#x2019;t remember ever needing to pee this badly. I calm myself by thinking of the strength I&#x2019;m building. The more I endure, the stronger I&#x2019;ll become.</p><p>This thought comes to my mind again, when the attendant tells me that my flight is no longer taking checked bags. &#x201C;Sorry, 6 PM is the cut-off&#x201D;, she says. I stop for a second. Then I realize, &#x201C;Wait isn&#x2019;t it 6:02?&#x201D;. She looks at me grimly. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing I can do.&#x201D;</p><p>A thousand thoughts and fears run through my head. Through all of them one message resounds clearer, louder. &#x201C;FIND THE BATHROOM.&#x201D; And I&#x2019;m off. Hobbling, with my massive duffel bag in my right hand, I make my way to the back of the lobby. Dismay ripples through every particle of my being when I arrive at the bathroom. There&#x2019;s a line.</p><p>I have never needed to pee this bad before. I probably missed my plane. Can I even do this? Should I just let it all go? It&#x2019;s a breaking point, a do or die moment. What path should I choose? I take a deep breath, and then it all makes sense.</p><p>This is another challenge. Another chance to test myself. I always have performed well under pressure. What will I do here? Collapse in a puddle of piss and sorrow? I think not. This is an opportunity to see how much I can take. And this is not where I will be broken.</p><p>As I mentally recount the story 30,000 feet in the air, I smile softly to myself. The madness of that day only continued. An hour and a half wait in line to change my flight, only to be told I had to rebook through my travel agency. A sleepless night, messaging back and forth with the trip supervisor. My mom, both yelling and crying. Guilt that she wasn&#x2019;t fast enough, and anger that I hadn&#x2019;t done enough.</p><p>Yet, here I was, on the path to Rome. And I was very much still in one piece.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Giornale]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I look around confused as I pull into parking lot V. &#xA0;The man in the toll booth gives me a quizzical stare when I try to explain that I&#x2019;m visiting for a class trip.

He gestures me on and gives an ambivalent shrug. I know I&#x2019;m in the right place when I see Professor Curley with a group of students in tow.</p><p>The transition from the parking garage to the concourse is blinding. As we step out of the elevator, sterile white rushes to replace the muted grays of the underground. The concourse is a portal. It is narrow and filled with movement; people hustle back and forth, coming and going. A classmate remarks it seems like an airport passageway. Another compares it to a train station. We all seem to agree that the concourse is, at its heart, a facilitator of motion. Even though it is dressed to be more, with colorful modern art decorating the walls, no one is fooled. A puppy with a tiara and a tutu is cute, but it&#x2019;s still a dog.</p><p>The Rockefeller Plaza is a different story. As I take in the view from the top of the museum steps, I&#x2019;m wowed by the sheer scale and grandiosity unfurled below me. The government agency buildings seem to float, concrete blending seamlessly into glass. They are stark and imperial, but awe inspiring, nonetheless. The vector that cuts through the center of the plaza brings the gaze to the capitol building. It is intricate, proud, and massive. A building fit for Hogwarts, or a billionaire&#x2019;s private estate. But, in a way, it brings the plaza together. The beauty and delicacy of the design, suitable for any location. It is a peacock at the party: distinct, outrageous, and resplendently stunning.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2023/04/IMG_0463.png" class="kg-image" alt="Giornale" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2023/04/IMG_0463.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>New York State Capitol Building</figcaption></figure><p>As we walk through the plaza, I get a closer view of the Egg. It is odd, but somehow loveable. Laughable and appreciable at the same time. The view, as I stand with my back to the capitol building, sends chills down my spine. Rockefeller&#x2019;s imperial dream complete in front of my eyes. The only element missing from the picture is a Death Star, that looms above the New York State Museum. Though the sight is not a stimulant of creativity, it does dredge up a certain admiration for the design and execution. The order and scale of the structures are impressive, and taken together, they are beautiful, in their own ominous way.</p><p>After we finish our loop, a group of us head off to grab a snack from a Greek food truck. The window is closed, but the owner decides to make an exception when he spies five hungry college customers. As he makes the food, we start to chat. &#x201C;You know half of people don&#x2019;t know anything about upper-level math.&#x201D;, he quips, his brow furrowed. I nod and tell him I&#x2019;m studying math and computer science. When he hears this, his expression changes, and his look becomes almost wistful. &#x201C;I was a math major in college&#x201D;, he says. &#x201C;I fucked up though, and now look where I am.&#x201D; At this he raises his hands and gestures around the food truck.</p><p>My interest is piqued, and I want to ask for his story. I hesitate though, unsure if I will come across as rude. Then, the group starts to leave, and I follow. As I walk, I look back, filled with regret at missing an opportunity to learn from the man, and maybe procure some pearls of wisdom.<br>As we walk, the wind picks up and trash ripples through the courtyard near the capitol building. For all its grandeur, the space is not very well maintained.</p><p>We settle down to eat at picnic tables near the Egg. I notice a man lying flat on his back, atop a table nearby. He appears to be sleeping. This is the first real use I&#x2019;ve seen of the amenities contained in the plaza. In a few minutes, the rest of the group starts to join us, and the man gets up and walks off. A little while later a cop car rolls through, headed in the exact same direction that the man had headed.</p><p>My experience at Empire State Plaza is one that highlights how important people are to any space. I&#x2019;m reminded of the periods in Rome&#x2019;s history when crime was high, conditions were poor, and people moved out of the city. Was it similar to the feel of the Empire State Plaza today? The whole mini tour, we were surrounded by structures of exorbitant scale. Billions of dollars turned to concrete and steel in every direction we looked, yet the space was flat, and felt dead without the touch of human life.</p><p>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;(Empire State Plaza.

Vibrant and mesmerizing, the canvas unfolds a pulsating web of rectangles, each one connected, each one essential to the harmony of the composition.</p><p><br>The observer&apos;s gaze is drawn into a captivating pattern of interlocking shapes, their varying sizes and orientations creating a sense of depth and movement. The colors of the artwork hold the gaze captive, each hue blending harmoniously with its neighbors, enhancing the visual appeal of the geometric forms.</p><p><br>As the viewer&apos;s eyes traverse the composition, they witness a delicate balance between positive and negative space, the solid forms of the rectangles interspersed with gaps that invite the imagination to wander. Within these voids, one may find themselves contemplating the infinite capacity of the geometric realm.</p><p><br>With each step back, the observer is further immersed in the intricate choreography of the shapes. The rectangles seem to undulate, creating an optical illusion that brings the static artwork to life. It is as if the composition is breathing, its lines and forms engaged in a harmonious dance that transcends the boundaries of the canvas.</p><p><br>The artwork is a testament to the beauty of simplicity and order, an ode to the power of mathematics to elevate the ordinary into the realm of the extraordinary. The observer is invited to dive into the language of lines, shapes, and colors, to explore their intricacies, and to appreciate their elegance in a way that transcends the physical world.</p><p>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;(My room, Max Bill, Geometrical Construction 1, 1970)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Voyeur]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Gideon sighs and settles into his chair.

His blue puffer jacket hangs off the back, limp and lifeless. Gideon wraps his hand around his paper coffee cup and takes a sip.</p><p>Where did it all go so wrong? At this thought he removes his black ribbed beanie to rest his head against his palms. Lisa. How many more chances would she give him?</p><p>Everything had been so easy growing up. Living here in Saratoga Springs, mom and dad had taken care of everything. Nice houses, nice vacations, and no stress. Never did Gideon still expect to be in his hometown fifty years later.</p><p>Gideon stares blankly at the wall. He takes off his small wireframe glasses, fogs each lens, and wipes them with his sweatshirt.</p><p>1 week. That&#x2019;s how long his boss had given him to pull his act together. Lisa was threatening divorce. All because of the damn drink. All because they didn&#x2019;t understand.</p><p>Bourbon was his way to cool off after work. Life was so stressful; didn&#x2019;t everyone need something to help them relax? Did he not put food on the table? Did he not pay for the kids absurdly expensive private school?</p><p>Yes, he did. He was the provider, and he deserved a way to destress. What was Lisa so mad about anyway? Him disappearing on weekends? Coming home 4 AM Monday morning? He was just having fun.</p><p>If everyone could just calm down and leave him alone, everything would be fine. If they could all just let him drink, there wouldn&#x2019;t be any problems.</p><p>At this, Gideon hears Lisa&#x2019;s tearful voice in his head. &#x201C;Gideon you need to stop, you&#x2019;re killing yourself! Please. If not for me, do it for the kids.&#x201D;</p><p>Gideon closes his eyes and leans back in his chair. She just didn&#x2019;t understand. No one understands. If everyone was reasonable, life wouldn&#x2019;t be so damn difficult.</p><p>Gideon checks his watch. 5:00 PM. About time to pick up his quart of bourbon for the night. He picks up his beanie and smiles to himself.</p><p>What could Lisa really do? Divorce him? Take the kids? No. She wouldn&#x2019;t. She loved him, didn&#x2019;t she? And anyway, he&#x2019;d just have one drink tonight. This quart would easily last him the week.</p><p>He just needed something to decompress. It had been a rough day at work. Just one.</p><p>With that, Gideon stands up, tosses out his quarter-full cup of coffee, and walks out.</p><p>(Uncommon Grounds.

The air is cool, it feels as if there&apos;s a slight draft coming from my right. </p><p>There are different flavors of voice all around. To my right excited exaltation ensues, in front of me serious tones deep in discourse, behind me lively exclamations coupled with table thumping.</p><p>The song changes, it&apos;s still Post Malone, just a sadder melody. TikTok turns on in front of me. I recognize the click of the snare drums in the short clips. A howl breaks out behind me, &#x201C;Let&apos;s gooooooo&#x201D;, followed by more table pounding. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; </p><p>A laugh ripples through the air, deep and hearty. There&apos;s a faint scent of tomato sauce mixed with grease; everything else passes unnoticed by my stuffy nose. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; </p><p>The collective hum has quieted to a whisper. The air feels cooler than before, like someone has opened a door or window. </p><p>I take a sip of my drink. Cold, the ice knock against my teeth. Sweet, I can taste the lemonade and cranberry swirling together as they roll through my mouth. I&apos;m left with a slightly tart aftertaste and a strong desire to take another sip. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; </p><p>This time I get a small piece of ice. I swirl it around with my tongue and and then pulverize it with a crunch.</p><p>A fridge closes in the distance, and a pot clangs in a sink. </p><p>The music has turned off now, though I think I hear the faint &#x201C;zzzzz&#x201D; of a radio somewhere in the distance.</p><p>The room moves like an ocean. Voices, like waves, swell to a peak and then crash into silence on the shore. They draw back into the sea with a collective sigh. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; </p><p>Post Malone turns back on. I recognize the song, but don&apos;t know the name. &#x201C;We&apos;re running out of reasons, but we can&apos;t let go.&#x201D; Hollywood is Bleeding. I guess I do know the name.</p><p>Three sharp raps on a table behind me grab my attention. I can&apos;t make out the words, but the tone of the conversation is jovial. Someone squeals out a laugh. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; </p><p>And then it becomes clear: the topic is girls. The mood changes, and an argument starts about the timeline of meeting two female friends. &#x201C;I literally spoke to her about the day&#x2026; why are you trying to tell me?!&#x201D;</p><p>A voice to my right cuts in, &#x201C;We&apos;re closing, please bring your dishes to the front.&#x201D; I nod, still enraptured in the moment. As I move to leave, Senorita by Sean Mendes starts to play. A fitting way to close out the night.</p><p>(Murray-Atkins Dining Hall.
