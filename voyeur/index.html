Lisa was threatening divorce. All because of the damn drink. All because they didn’t understand.</p><p>Bourbon was his way to cool off after work. Life was so stressful; didn’t everyone need something to help them relax? Did he not put food on the table? Did he not pay for the kids absurdly expensive private school?</p><p>Yes, he did. He was the provider, and he deserved a way to destress. What was Lisa so mad about anyway? Him disappearing on weekends? Coming home 4 AM Monday morning? He was just having fun.</p><p>If everyone could just calm down and leave him alone, everything would be fine. If they could all just let him drink, there wouldn’t be any problems.</p><p>At this, Gideon hears Lisa’s tearful voice in his head. “Gideon you need to stop, you’re killing yourself! Please. If not for me, do it for the kids.”</p><p>Gideon closes his eyes and leans back in his chair. She just didn’t understand. No one understands. If everyone was reasonable, life wouldn’t be so damn difficult.</p><p>Gideon checks his watch. 5:00 PM. About time to pick up his quart of bourbon for the night. He picks up his beanie and smiles to himself.</p><p>What could Lisa really do? Divorce him? Take the kids? No. She wouldn’t. She loved him, didn’t she? And anyway, he’d just have one drink tonight. This quart would easily last him the week.</p><p>He just needed something to decompress. It had been a rough day at work. Just one.</p><p>With that, Gideon stands up, tosses out his quarter-full cup of coffee, and walks out.</p><p>(Uncommon Grounds. Febraury 27, 2023. 4:30 PM - 5:05 PM)</p>
